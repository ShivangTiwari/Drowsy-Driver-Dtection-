# Drowsy-Driver-Detection
A sensor and actuator based project which make use of eye blink sensor, buzzer and power supply to prevent driver falling asleep by a beep sound if the driver has closed eyes for more than 5 seconds.
One can increase or decrease the time gap easily, by making changes in the code. Also this project can be used reversely by coma patients so as to see if they have opened their eyes for a while(and no one was near to watch).
